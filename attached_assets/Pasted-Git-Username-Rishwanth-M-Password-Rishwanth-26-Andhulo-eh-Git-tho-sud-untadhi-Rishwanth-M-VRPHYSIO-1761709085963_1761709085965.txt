I have a physiotherapy website built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JS — all content and text are already filled in. The codebase is here: [Rishwanth-M/VRPHYSIO URL].

Please redesign the website to make it look modern, clean, and professional, while keeping all existing content and structure intact (text, images, and functionality must remain).

Design direction:
	•	Use a lime blue / bright blue theme as the primary color (combine with white, light gray, and subtle gradients).
	•	Apply modern Bootstrap 5 layout and utility classes for responsiveness.
	•	Add glassmorphism effects for cards, modals, or section backgrounds (semi-transparent with blur).
	•	Use smooth animations and scroll effects — for example, fade-ins, slide-ins, hover effects, and parallax backgrounds.
	•	Include visualized data sections like:
	•	Physiotherapy recovery statistics
	•	Patient improvement metrics (with animated progress bars or charts using Chart.js or CSS)
	•	Add subtle shadow and depth to buttons and components for a polished look.
	•	Improve the navbar design (sticky, with hover transitions).
	•	Redesign the hero section to have a stronger impact (background image or video overlay with tagline and call-to-action).
	•	Make sure mobile responsiveness is perfect across devices.

Content considerations:
	•	Do not remove any existing content — keep all headings, paragraphs, and images.
	•	You may add new relevant sections such as:
	•	“Why Choose Us” with icons and short text
	•	“Patient Testimonials” with cards or carousel
	•	“Our Achievements” or “Certifications” section
	•	“Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)” section
	•	Ensure everything aligns with a professional physiotherapy / medical brand identity.

Additional polish:
	•	Use modern Google Fonts for readability (e.g., “Poppins”, “Inter”, or “Nunito”).
	•	Optimize colors and contrast for accessibility.
	•	Include a simple, elegant footer redesign with contact info and social media icons.
	•	Add smooth scroll behavior for navigation.

Please output the updated code for all relevant files (HTML, CSS, JS), or create a new branch called redesign with these updates.

The live version of the site is at https://vrphysio.netlify.app — please use it as a visual reference to understand the current structure.
